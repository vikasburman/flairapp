1. multer needs to be used - especially to upload/use file(s)
2. reCaptcha implementation must be very clean
3. oojs update is not working correctly - half file is getting downloaded -- check...
4. set request in env and give way to read it from anywhere -- but response should not be available
5. request handlers must have endpoint attribute -- auth should be defined in endpoint
6. endpoints must be async, so that request object can be set in environment before and removed after
