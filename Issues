1. multer needs to be used - especially to upload/use file(s)
2. reCaptcha implementation must be very clean
3. oojs update is not working correctly - half file is getting downloaded -- check...
4. in dbg mode dummy is not loading, so failing
5. prod mode is also not working - minUptime and spinSleepTime not set and exiting

7. add check attribute 

attr('check', 'type', 'number');
attr('check', 'range', 0, 10);

attr('check', 'null', false);

attr('check', 'type', 'number');
attr('check', 'gte', 10);

many more...
