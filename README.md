_True object orientation features for plain vanilla JavaScript_

What is this? 
---

This repository sets up a boilerplate project structure for building an all JavaScript app based using _NodeJS_ + _Flair.js_ on server and _Flair.js_ + _Vue.js_ on client.

This boilerplate is good for simple apps where both app and web files are served from the same server. For complex apps, with distributed deployment scenarios, use [flairappx](https://github.com/vikasburman/flairappx) boilerplate project structure instead.
