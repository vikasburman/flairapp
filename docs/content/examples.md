Examples
========

All examples are fully working combination of user-interface and javascript files, and are organized in their individual folders [here](https://github.com/vikasburman/flairjs/tree/master/examples).

Each example folder has a starting point as _index.html_ (for client side cases) or an _index.js_ (for server side cases). Sufficient comments are placed in code files to help understanding the concept. Ideal approach is to run example either by opening the _index.html_ or loading the _index.js_ (on node server) and see things running on console. Most of the behaviors, that an example tries to showcase, are emitted on console for easy understanding and debugging through. 

Below mentioned are links to examples which are most relevant to these individual concepts.
